When we are going to start with OpenCV first we have to learn about :

1. How to open Web Cam using OpenCV
2. How to Capture image and read data from image.

Open WebCam just run the command :

.. code-block:: text
   python open_webcam.py
   
   
Capture Image and Read data :

.. code-block:: text
   python click_image.py
